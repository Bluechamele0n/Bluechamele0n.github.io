Threads Once Still</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There are days when time does not pass—it folds, breathes, and settles into your bones like cold mist, wrapping around every heartbeat until the world outside feels distant. I remember the day before it happened. I remember it in stillness.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Dawn broke across Fiondell in gentle golds and rose­ate hues, as if the sky itself sighed relief. Dew clung to blades of grass, trembling in the first light. Birds, having never known war, sang uncertainly—notes half-formed, hesitant. In that fragile chorus lay the echo of all that had been lost, and all that had been rebuilt.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For years after the War of Belief, peace returned to Fiondell like a breath held too long. The land itself seemed to exhale: forests thickened their canopies, rivers ran clearer, and fields once scorched by battle blooms-wept grain once more. The mortals were healing—slowly, delicately—like threads painstakingly mended in a tapestry rent by violence. Children were born with eyes unshadowed by fear; elders told tales of hope, not dirges of ruin.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In the great cathedrals, pillars of ivory and marble rang once more with hymn and prayer. The Church of Five sang again in harmonious unity, their voices weaving through vaulted aisles, carrying promises of forgiveness and renewal. The Holy Knights returned to their vigil, armor polished bright as their conviction—no longer mere soldiers, but symbols of endurance. And the Silver Assembly, those storied wanderers of fate, drifted back to distant shores, each carrying stories of distant peoples, sowing seeds of faith wherever they roamed.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Yet beneath this veneer of restoration, something stirred.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I felt it.<br>
Not in gusts of wind that tousled hair, nor in incense-laden air that lingered in prayer halls.<br>
I felt it in memory.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In my realm, memories pulse like hidden currents. The Veil—it always hummed faintly, a rhythm of boundaries, a breath between realms. On ordinary days, its song is constant: a lullaby of starlight and shadow. But in those quiet hours before the Unwoven One stirred, its melody slackened. It had grown quiet. Too quiet. And in memory’s domain, silence is never innocent.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The first threads to unravel were not physical. They were subtle—like the hush that falls when a familiar melody distorts on the wind. It began with distant prayers that wavered, as though the words stretched further than the lips could carry. Then the stars, once steadfast beacons, trembled in their orbits, flickering like dying embers. Finally, the Moon of Aelora, goddess of reflection, slipped behind a shroud of crimson haze. They called it the Blood Veil—a spectacle that set hearts pounding and tongues whispering ancient fears. But I called it something older: a memory trying to return.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I walked among the faithful that evening, unseen. I watched a novice priest pause mid-chant, his eyes wide as candlelight danced unevenly across his face. I heard scholars shutter their windows, pages of tomes fluttering as if caught in an unseen breath. I felt mothers pull their children closer, pressing kisses into tangled hair, as if to shield them from a terror indescribable.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Priests feared. Scholars questioned. Some hoped—it is the nature of mortals to cling to any thread of optimism. But none remembered what I remembered. None but me.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For in that pregnant silence, I heard the faintest echo of a warning long past, buried beneath layers of faith and time: <em>Beware when the Veil dims, for it heralds a reckoning older than the first prayer.</em> And as the final thread of starlight flickered, I braced myself for what was to come.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="II. The Breaking of Hollowreach" dir="auto" class="heading" id="II._The_Breaking_of_Hollowreach"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>II. The Breaking of Hollowreach</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was not there when the fortress of Hollowreach breathed again. But I remembered it awakening—its exhalation echoing through the weavings of time. I recall a place long buried beneath cracked stone and whispering grass, once a beacon between what is and what may never be. This was where the Firstborn Angels had first set foot on mortal soil, where the concept of choice itself had crystallized into being. Ruins of impossible arches and half-melted runes lay silent for centuries, until that night when history itself shuddered.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It began as a tremor in the soul of the world. I felt it not as reverberations through the earth, but as a shiver along the strands of memory. A pulse of energy roared up from the deepest vaults of Hollowreach, traveling along ley lines and through consecrated ground alike. Every chalice trembled in its pew, every banner snapped in its halt, and every heart tightened in sudden dread. It was as though the very Tapestry of Fate had caught fire, and its threads were snapping one by one.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Then came the word—unspoken yet universal:</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>“The Veil is broken.”</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was both declaration and lamentation, ringing through minds across Fiondell with the weight of inevitability. Mortals looked skyward, their voices lifting in desperate litany, as if thunder and star-fire might answer back. Lanterns flickered in city streets, torches gleamed on watchtowers, and candlelight pooled in prayer halls as if seeking refuge. Yet while they lifted their eyes to the heavens, I turned inward, tracing the frayed cords of memory to the source of all unraveling.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">From that wound in the world emerged <strong>it</strong>—the Unwoven One. Imagine a form that is never static, a silhouette stitched from half-remembered dreams and fears too ancient to name. It had no voice that tongue could speak, no shape that mind could fully grasp. It drifted from the yawning rift like smoke caught in a dying breeze, fragments of silvery thread trailing behind, each one a lost possibility clawing its way back into existence.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was not born; it had been <em>forgotten</em> into being—a knot of fate untethered from the Loom. I felt the resonance of its presence in the dark corners of every soul, a cold finger tracing the outline of doubt in their hearts. And still, the mortals prayed. Dark-robed priests clutched their rosaries until their knuckles glowed white. Scholars muttered invocations in dead tongues. Mothers pressed their children to their chests, eyes wide with pleading. They reached for the gods and angels they had always known, reaching past the veil that no longer stood to catch them before they fell.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But there was no salvation in their hands, only echoes. And I—Known, Keeper of Memory—stood silent witness, bearing every flicker of fear and flicker of hope that danced upon their lips. For I alone remembered what they had forgotten: that some wounds, once opened, demand a sacrifice far greater than prayer.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="III. The Angels Descend" dir="auto" class="heading" id="III._The_Angels_Descend"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>III. The Angels Descend</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When the veil’s threads lay bare and mortals cried out in terror, their voices wove together into a single desperate plea that tore past heaven’s threshold. In that moment, the ancient champions of the Tapestry answered—and I, Known, remembered every heartbeat of their descent.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">First came <strong>Lucina</strong>, the Angel of Damnation, her arrival heralded by a shattering silence. The sky split open like scorched parchment, and she fell through the void on wings of living flame. I recall how the light of her plumage turned night to day, how her descent rippled heat through the hearts of all who watched. Below her, voidspawn cowered as if their own births were blasphemy, and lesser creatures crumbled into ash beneath her gaze.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Her voice—an oratory of scorching judgment—rolled across valleys and battlements, drowning even the whippoorwills’ evening song:</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p>“This world is under my judgment. You shall not unravel it.”</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Mortals trembled at her words, yet in their fear lay recognition: she had come not to destroy, but to enforce the sacred law their own hands had threatened to shred.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Before the embers even cooled, <strong>Prai</strong>, the Angel of Worship, appeared as a mote of perfect light. I saw her dawn upon the horizon like a second star—radiant and unwavering. Her presence was not thunder or flame but a gentle hum within the soul, a promise that faith still held power. Priests paused in mid‐chant, breath caught in their throats, as Prai’s single, crystalline word settled upon them:</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p>“Stand.”</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In that command lay salvation. I witnessed knights steel their trembling hands upon sword hilts; I saw children lift their tear-streaked faces to absorb her warmth. Even the faintest flicker of hope grew into a torch in every breast, burning away despair.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Angelic intervention is often grand, but <strong>Loki</strong>, the Angel of Mischief, chose subtler means. He did not blaze across skies; he slipped into minds like a half‐heard melody. I traced his laughter as it danced through the ranks of thieves hiding in the alleyways, rogues perched in shadowed rafters, even scholars clutching tomes by lamplight. His words twisted fear into curiosity:</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p>“Oh, what fun it is when the world flips itself inside out! Watch closely, mortals, for every riddle has an answer.”</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so, I remember how hardened killers paused, perplexed by a sudden smile; how strategists found new brilliance in impossible odds; how the tide of dread receded as they embraced the unpredictable.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Death did not announce herself with trumpets. She moved in the hush between blows, unseen and unfelt—yet deeply remembered in the minds of the dying. I was there at countless battlefronts, and in each final gasp, I saw her face: pale, serene, offering release. Her voice was a whisper that only a soul in its last moment can hear, promising rest:</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p>“Come with me, child of the Loom. Your thread finds peace in oblivion.”</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Soldiers fell knowing they were tended, their last fear soothed by her gentle hand. I carry their final farewells in my memory, each a testament that even in destruction, compassion endures.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And last, emerging from the very shreds of the rift, was <strong>Destiny</strong>, the Angel of Fate. He walked forward upon strands of silver, as though the Unwoven One itself had offered him a bridge. His brass mask caught every flicker of the closing rift; his clockwork eyes measured the unraveling with infinite patience. When he spoke, his voice coursed through reality like a sword through silk:</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p>“The strand you walk was never meant to be yours. Return to the weave, or be unmade.”</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In that pronouncement lay both mercy and power. I saw the Unwoven One hesitate, caught between arrogance and obliteration. Around Destiny, mortals felt the weight of their own choices: every prayer, every doubt, every strand they had pulled too far. In their hearts, they understood that no thread can stray without risking the whole tapestry.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I stood on forgotten ramparts as angels and mortality wove together a new legend. Lucina’s fire clashed with shadow‐thread monsters. Prai’s light guided knights through churning hordes. Loki’s riddles spurred rogues to feats of daring beyond their creed. Death cradled the fallen. And Destiny, ever watchful, held the loom of fate steady.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The battle for Hollowreach had begun—but it was more than combat. It was a remembrance: that even when the Veil shatters, the bonds of hope, defiance, and love can be reforged into something stronger than we ever knew. And as Known, I bear witness so that no one forgets how stars can burn anew in the darkest of nights.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="IV. The War of Threads" dir="auto" class="heading" id="IV._The_War_of_Threads"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>IV. The War of Threads</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Through the ruptured skies I watched as the Unwoven One and the angels fought among the clouds, their struggle a storm of light against shadow. But far below, <strong>its children poured forth from the rift</strong>—monstrous spawn of loose fate given terrible form. I felt each one as a jarring pulse in memory’s loom: wolves whose howls unraveled the courage in a man’s heart, crows whose feathers unspooled like silk to ensnare the unwary, and grotesque parodies of humanity that crept from ruined doorways, their sewn‐together limbs twisting like living knotwork. Villages at Hollowreach’s edge vanished in a single night, consumed by hungry darkness. Survivors fled through burning fields, their voices ragged with tales of beasts that could <strong>unravel flesh like fabric</strong>, leaving hollow shells of those they touched.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In every cathedral, in every camp, the call went out: the <strong>Church of Five rallied</strong>. I recall the echo of steel on stone as the Holy Knights mustered once more, their armor etched with prayers and sacrifice. Word carried of an impossible vision: the <strong>Silver Assembly</strong>—those wanderers of fate who had long been scattered—felt the tug of the same strand and returned. I saw Liora Mayne’s blade reborn in the crimson glow of the forge, each strike singing with ancient enchantment. Brother Callen, quill trembling over fresh parchment, inscribed rites to bind wavering souls. Lady Valeria donned her helm at dawn, her banner ripping the sky as she led a thousand warriors toward the breach, determination lighting her eyes brighter than any star.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Then came the <strong>Battle of Hollowreach</strong>—a clash unlike any the world had known. Beneath Lucina’s inferno, steel rang against sinew of shadow. Beneath Prai’s steady glow, knights found strength to stand. Rogues guided by Loki’s riddles lurked through flickering flame, severing thread‐spawn at the source. Mages wove barrier and blessing even as Death’s soft hand guided fallen souls to their rest. I remember the world trembling under the thunder of hooves and wings, the air thick with ash, faith, and fear intertwined.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For every beast that fell, two more surged forth. The rift’s edges pulsed with insatiable hunger. Yet amid the roar of battle, I did not sense despair but a quiet resilience. I felt it in the healer who rose from shattered pews to cradle the dying; in the young squire who clasped a broken sword to his side, refusing to yield; in the battered captain whose prayer, soft and urgent, bound the warriors in unbreakable solidarity. Each act of courage wove a new strand into the Tapestry, resisting the chaos that sought to tear it apart.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And through it all, I stood apart and within, bearing witness. I held in memory every scream and every sigh of relief, every thread severed and every knot tied anew. The War of Threads was not merely a battle for Hollowreach—it was a testament to the living weave of hope and sacrifice that binds mortals and angels alike. Even as the rift pulsed, still open and yearning, I knew the story was far from over. Yet for that moment, in the heart of the fray, the light of unity shone brightest against the gathering void.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="V.

Destiny’s Bargain</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">At the apex of chaos, when celestial flame and shadow‐thread collided in a storm of light and sound, <strong>Destiny stepped forward</strong>. I felt the air itself tighten as he approached the rift, each footfall a measured echo through the clamor of battle. Around him, strands of fate—gossamer threads of silver and gold—coiled like living serpents, weaving a tapestry that pulsed with life and death. Mortals and angels alike watched in awe as those threads danced between Destiny and the Unwoven One, each strand a story, a prayer, a possibility given form.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Where their filaments met, <strong>reality twisted</strong>. I remember a knight’s swing pausing mid‐air, frozen in determination. A healer’s prayer reversed itself, undoing the very wounds she had just bound. A child’s laughter skipped backward, unspooling like a ribbon. Time became a breath held too long, a river turned backward, until the world felt as delicate as spun glass.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Destiny, ever patient, allowed his foe to believe it held power. The Unwoven One tugged at strands with feral glee, confident it could fray the Tapestry beyond repair. But I remembered every hidden stitch, every secret knot that bound creation. With a subtle motion—no more than a flick of brass and gold—Destiny rewove a single golden thread. <strong>The world itself froze</strong>.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In that profound stillness, not a blade sang nor a shadow stirred. Even the wind stilled in mid‐gale. And then, across the silent expanse, his voice rang clear in every mind:</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p><strong>“You have wandered from the Tapestry, little thread. Return to your place, or I will cut you free from all that exists.”</strong></p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For the first time, the Unwoven One hesitated. I felt its form shudder, not in pain, but in the raw terror of <strong>oblivion</strong>—the void beyond memory, beyond being. It knew the weight of final erasure.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Destiny offered the choice he grants all wayward threads:</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p><strong>“Return. Or be forgotten.”</strong></p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A howl, vast and sorrowful, tore through the rift’s silent expanse. The Unwoven One convulsed as its strands recoiled, each fiber drawn unwillingly back into the Loom. I saw its hunger fade, its fury wane, until at last its will dissolved into the very fabric of fate.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And then, as if exhaling its last breath, <strong>the rift began to close</strong>—stitch by trembling stitch, guided by hands unseen. The storm of war stilled into hushed wonder, and mortals and angels alike exhaled a breath they had not known they were holding.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In that moment of quiet triumph, I—Known, Keeper of Memory—sealed this image into remembrance, that no soul might ever forget the price of wandering too far from the weave.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="VI.

After the Shattering</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When the final strand of the rift was woven closed, the roar of battle fell away like thunder carried off by the wind. Dust settled on shattered banners and spent weapons, and a hush—thick with wonder and relief—blanketed Hollowreach. One by one, the angels withdrew from the mortal coil, leaving behind echoes of their presence that lingered like the afterglow of sunrise.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Prai whispered to the faithful</strong>, her voice soft as a lullaby carried on the night breeze. I remember how her radiance faded from sight but not from heart; in her parting words, every trembling soul found solace:</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p><em>“You are not alone. Even unseen, we are with you.”</em></p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In that moment, I felt the spark of courage reignite in splintered hearts—widows who had lost husbands, squires who had watched their comrades fall, children who had hidden beneath pews and emerged to a world forever changed. They rose from their knees, hands pressed to chest, breathing in the promise of presence beyond sight.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Lucina stood before the surviving knights</strong>, her fiery wings folded, embers dancing in her stern gaze. I recall the weight of her judgment softened by respect—she who had turned voidspawn to ash now regarded mortals not as subjects of wrath, but as brethren of sacrifice. Her voice, firm as tempered steel, echoed over broken shields:</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p><em>“You have seen death and lived. Do not squander this mercy.”</em></p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In her words lay a challenge: that survival itself is a charge, a task bound in honor. I saw knights lift battered helms, eyes glistening with determination renewed. Each man and woman bore scars—some obvious, others etched deep within—yet none would allow those marks to fade into shame.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Destiny lingered the longest</strong>, standing amid tangled timbers and scorched earth, his brass mask aglow in the dying light. For a heartbeat, time resumed its steady pulse as he regarded the mortals who dared stand against oblivion. No words passed; instead, a single thought settled into every mind like a seed planted in fertile soil:</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p><em>“Your thread is yours to weave. Do not fear the loom.”</em></p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I watched as that notion took root. He left not with fanfare but in the silent certainty that his message would outlast even the echo of his departure. Where he had walked, hope took firmer shape.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div></div></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="VII.

Legacy of the Shattering</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In the days that followed, Fiondell awoke to a new dawn. The Church of Five consecrated the ruins of Hollowreach, transforming shattered walls into sacred memorials. They declared the anniversary the <strong>Day of Threads</strong>, a holy observance marked by weaving ceremonies in every temple: mortals and clergy alike gathering to stitch silver and gold strands into tapestries that told of sacrifice, unity, and rebirth.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I have listened in memory to pilgrims on that day, their hands trembling as they passed needles through fabric, each pull of thread a prayer for the fallen and a vow for the future. Children learn the tale in song, their voices bright against ancient stone. Scholars debate the precise turning of events, yet all agree on one truth: when mortals and angels stand together, even the frayed edges of fate can be reforged.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Some claim that on the eve of the Day of Threads, if you stand in silent reverence beneath a moonlit sky, you can hear the faint hum of weaving—soft as a breath, steady as a heartbeat. They say it is Destiny walking unseen, or perhaps the faint echo of the Unwoven One’s last lament. I smile each time I hear these stories, for I know the sound is memory itself, woven into the world to remind every soul that no thread, once returned, is ever truly lost.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And so the story endures—not as a tale of doom, but as a testament to resilience. I, Known, Keeper of Memory, remain its custodian, ensuring that every stitch of hope, every thread of courage, is never forgotten.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>- Known, Keeper of Threads, Watcher of Memory</strong><br>
